# Structural_Patterns_Project
# ðŸ§© Structural Patterns Project

A clean and practical implementation of the **seven classic Structural Design Patterns** in C#.  
This project demonstrates how to assemble objects and classes into **flexible, maintainable, and scalable structures**.

It reflects my ability to apply software-design best practices to real-world code using **modular and reusable** solutions.

## ðŸ§  Why Structural Patterns?

Structural patterns help organize relationships between objects. They are essential for:

- Simplifying complex class architectures  
- Reusing code more effectively  
- Adapting interfaces or hiding system complexity  
- Improving performance (e.g., memory sharing in Flyweight)

---

## ðŸ§± Implemented Patterns

Each pattern includes:
- Clear interface and implementation  
- A working console demo showing practical usage  

### âœ… Included Patterns

- **Adapter** â€“ Wraps incompatible interfaces  
- **Bridge** â€“ Decouples abstraction from implementation  
- **Composite** â€“ Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly  
- **Decorator** â€“ Adds behavior dynamically  
- **Facade** â€“ Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem  
- **Flyweight** â€“ Shares state to reduce memory usage  
- **Proxy** â€“ Controls access to objects (e.g., lazy loading, protection)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Language:** C# (.NET Core)  
- **Architecture:**  
  - Separate folders for each design pattern  
  - Interface + Implementation + Demo per pattern  
  - SOLID principles, clean naming, minimal dependencies  
- **Testing & Demos:**  
  - Console-based examples demonstrate real-world usage
